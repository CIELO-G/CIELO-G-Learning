## What Are the Layers of the Earth?
**The Earth is not a single solid ball — it is made up of multiple layers**, each with different materials, properties, and states of matter. These layers explain many natural phenomena, including volcanoes, earthquakes, and the magnetic field.

| Layer         | Composition                        | State        | Thickness            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| **Crust**     | Rocks (granite, basalt)             | Solid        | 5–70 km              |
| **Mantle**    | Silicate minerals (iron, magnesium) | Semi-solid   | 2,900 km             |
| **Outer Core**| Iron and nickel                    | Liquid       | 2,200 km             |
| **Inner Core**| Iron and nickel                    | Solid        | 1,250 km (radius)    |

:::important[Did you know?]
* The crust, where we live, is thinner than the skin of an apple compared to the rest of the Earth!
* The inner core is hotter than the surface of the Sun, reaching temperatures over 5,000°C.
* Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of the liquid outer core.

## **1. Crust**
The outermost and thinnest layer of the Earth.

- Made mostly of rocks like granite and basalt.
- Divided into **continental crust** and **oceanic crust**.
- Tectonic plates "float" on the mantle below.

---

## **2. Mantle**
The layer beneath the crust that behaves like a very slow-moving solid.

- Extends to a depth of **~2,900 kilometers**.
- Heat-driven convection currents here cause tectonic plate movement.
- Despite being mostly solid, it can flow over long periods.

---

## **3. Outer Core**
A liquid layer that surrounds the inner core.

- Composed mainly of molten iron and nickel.
- Movement within the outer core generates Earth's magnetic field.

---

## **4. Inner Core**
The Earth's deepest, hottest layer.

- Solid sphere made of iron and nickel.
- Despite the extreme heat (over **5,000°C**), it remains solid due to immense pressure.
- Plays a critical role in Earth's internal energy and magnetism.

## **Common Misconceptions**
:::caution
The mantle is not completely molten! It is mostly solid rock that flows very slowly under intense heat and pressure.

## Key Takeaways:

- **The crust** is where we live, made up of solid rocks.
- **The mantle** is a hot, flowing layer driving plate tectonics.
- **The outer core** is liquid metal, generating the magnetic field.
- **The inner core** is a solid metal ball hotter than the Sun’s surface.
